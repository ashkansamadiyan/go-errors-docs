# Cleaner Code with Early Returns in TypeScript

Have you ever found yourself lost in a maze of nested if statements, trying to follow the logic of a function? You're not alone. As codebases grow, deeply nested conditions become one of the biggest enemies of code readability and maintainability. This is where the power of early returns comes in, and when combined with `go-errors`, it becomes an even more powerful pattern for writing clean, maintainable code.

## The Pyramid of Doom: A Common Anti-Pattern

We've all written code like this at some point. It starts innocently enough with a simple validation, but as requirements grow, the nesting gets deeper and deeper:

```typescript
function processPayment(data: unknown) {
  if (data && typeof data === 'object') {
    if ('amount' in data && typeof data.amount === 'number') {
      if (data.amount > 0) {
        if ('currency' in data && typeof data.currency === 'string') {
          if (['USD', 'EUR'].includes(data.currency)) {
            return chargePayment(data.amount, data.currency);
          } else {
            throw new Error('Invalid currency');
          }
        } else {
          throw new Error('Missing currency');
        }
      } else {
        throw new Error('Amount must be positive');
      }
    } else {
      throw new Error('Invalid amount');
    }
  } else {
    throw new Error('Invalid data');
  }
}
```

This is what we call the "Pyramid of Doom" - a pattern that's unfortunately common in many codebases. Each level of nesting makes the code:
- Harder to read and understand
- More difficult to modify
- Prone to bugs
- Challenging to test
- A nightmare to maintain

I once spent hours debugging an issue in a similar function, only to realize that a condition was nested at the wrong level. The deeper the nesting, the easier it is to make such mistakes.

## The Early Returns Revolution

Enter early returns - a pattern that flips this approach on its head. Instead of nesting conditions deeper and deeper, we validate and return early when something's wrong. When combined with `go-errors`, this creates a powerful and elegant solution:

```typescript
import { go } from 'go-errors';

function processPayment(data: unknown) {
  // Validate structure
  if (!data || typeof data !== 'object') {
    return [null, new ValidationError('Invalid data')] as const;
  }

  // Validate amount
  if (!('amount' in data) || typeof data.amount !== 'number') {
    return [null, new ValidationError('Invalid amount')] as const;
  }
  if (data.amount <= 0) {
    return [null, new ValidationError('Amount must be positive')] as const;
  }

  // Validate currency
  if (!('currency' in data) || typeof data.currency !== 'string') {
    return [null, new ValidationError('Missing currency')] as const;
  }
  if (!['USD', 'EUR'].includes(data.currency)) {
    return [null, new ValidationError('Invalid currency')] as const;
  }

  // Process payment
  return go(() => chargePayment(data.amount, data.currency));
}
```

Look at how much clearer this is! Each validation is a single level, with a clear purpose and immediate return if something's wrong. This transformation makes the code:
- Easy to read from top to bottom
- Simple to modify or add new validations
- Clear about what's being checked
- Self-documenting

## Real-World Success Stories

Let me share a real-world example that transformed our team's approach to validation. We had an API endpoint handling user registration that was becoming increasingly complex. New requirements kept adding more validation rules, and our nested approach was becoming unsustainable.

Here's how we applied early returns to handle API requests:

```typescript
async function handleRequest(req: unknown) {
  // Validate request
  const [body, parseError] = go(() => JSON.parse(req as string));
  if (parseError) {
    return [null, new ApiError(400, 'Invalid JSON')] as const;
  }

  // Validate auth
  const [token, authError] = await go(validateAuth(body));
  if (authError) {
    return [null, new ApiError(401, 'Unauthorized')] as const;
  }

  // Process request
  return processRequest(body, token);
}
```

The impact was immediate:
1. Bug reports related to validation dropped significantly
2. New team members could understand the code faster
3. Adding new validation rules became trivial
4. Testing became more straightforward

## The Art of Validation

One of the most common use cases for early returns is form validation. Here's a pattern that has served us well:

```typescript
function validateForm(input: unknown) {
  // Check structure
  if (!input || typeof input !== 'object') {
    return [null, new FormError('Invalid input')] as const;
  }

  // Check email
  const email = (input as any).email;
  if (!email || !email.includes('@')) {
    return [null, new FormError('Invalid email')] as const;
  }

  // Success case
  return [{ email }, null] as const;
}
```

This pattern has become our standard approach because it:
- Makes validation rules explicit
- Keeps error messages close to their checks
- Makes it easy to add new validations
- Provides clear feedback for users

## Lessons from the Trenches

Through implementing this pattern across multiple projects, we've developed some best practices that have proven invaluable:

### 1. Clear Validation Order

Order your validations logically, from basic to complex:

```typescript
async function createUser(input: unknown) {
  // 1. Structure validation
  if (!isValidUserData(input)) {
    return [null, new ValidationError('Invalid data')] as const;
  }

  // 2. Business rules
  const [exists] = await go(checkUserExists(input.email));
  if (exists) {
    return [null, new ValidationError('User exists')] as const;
  }

  // 3. External operations
  return go(saveUser(input));
}
```

### 2. Descriptive Error Types

Make your error types work for you:

```typescript
class ValidationError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string, public field?: string) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'ValidationError';
  }
}

function validate(data: unknown) {
  if (!data) {
    return [null, new ValidationError('Missing data')] as const;
  }
  return [data, null] as const;
}
```

### 3. Meaningful Error Context

Always provide context with your errors:

```typescript
function processOrder(order: unknown) {
  const [validated, error] = validateOrder(order);
  if (error) {
    return [null, new Error(
      `Order validation failed: ${error.message}`
    )] as const;
  }
  return [validated, null] as const;
}
```

## The Impact on Development

Adopting early returns with `go-errors` has had far-reaching benefits:

1. **Better Readability**
   - Code flows naturally from top to bottom
   - Each validation stands alone
   - Intent is clear at every step

2. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript can better understand our code
   - Error types are preserved
   - Invalid states are impossible

3. **Maintainability**
   - Adding new validations is straightforward
   - Removing old ones is safe
   - Changes are localized

## A Cultural Transformation

The most surprising benefit wasn't technical - it was cultural. Our team's code reviews became more focused on business logic rather than untangling complex conditions. Junior developers could contribute with confidence, knowing the pattern would guide them toward clean, maintainable code.

## Looking Forward

Early returns with `go-errors` isn't just a pattern - it's a philosophy about how code should be structured. It encourages us to:
1. Validate early
2. Return immediately on errors
3. Keep the success path clean
4. Use descriptive error types

The result? Code that's not just functional, but a joy to work with. Code that tells a story, that guides the reader through its logic naturally. Code that we can confidently modify, extend, and maintain.

Try this pattern in your next project. Start small, perhaps with a single validation function. Watch how it transforms not just your code, but how you think about structuring your applications. Share your experiences with your team, and let's continue building more maintainable, more reliable software together.
