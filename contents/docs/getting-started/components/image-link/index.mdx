# Links and Images

In this documentation, all links and images written in Markdown are automatically converted to their respective Next.js components. This allows for better optimization and performance in your application.

## Links

Links are automatically converted to Next.js `Link` components when they are internal links, and to regular `a` tags when they are external links.

```md
[Internal Link](/docs/getting-started)
[External Link](https://github.com/ashkansamadiyan/go-style-errors)
```

## Images

Images are automatically optimized using Next.js Image component:

```md
![Alt Text](/path/to/image.png)
```

## Custom Components

You can also use custom components for more advanced use cases:

```tsx
<CustomLink href="/docs/advanced">Advanced Guide</CustomLink>
<CustomImage src="/example.png" alt="Example" />
```

## Benefits

- **Performance Optimization**: Automatic conversion to Next.js components ensures optimized loading of images and links.
- **Improved User Experience**: Client-side navigation with Next.js `Link` improves the browsing experience.
- **Responsive Images**: Next.js `Image` component handles responsive images, providing the best quality for various device sizes.

By utilizing these features, you can ensure that your documentation is not only visually appealing but also performs efficiently.
