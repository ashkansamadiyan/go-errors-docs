# Installation

Getting started with go-errors is straightforward. You can install it using bun:

```bash
bun add go-errors
```

## TypeScript Configuration

go-errors is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions out of the box. No additional configuration is required for TypeScript projects.

For optimal usage, ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```

## Verifying Installation

You can verify your installation by creating a simple test file:

```typescript
import { goSync } from 'go-errors';

// Try a simple synchronous operation
let [value, err] = goSync(() => {
  return "Installation successful!";
});

if (err) {
  console.error("Something went wrong:", err.message);
} else {
  console.log(value); // Should print "Installation successful!"
}
```
