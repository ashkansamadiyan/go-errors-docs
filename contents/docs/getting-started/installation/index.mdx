```

    "esModuleInterop": true
  }
}
```

## Verifying Installation

You can verify your installation by creating a simple test file:

```typescript
import { go } from 'go-errors';

// Try a simple synchronous operation
const [value, error] = go(() => {
  return "Installation successful!";
});

if (error) {
  console.error("Something went wrong:", error.message);
} else {
  console.log(value); // Should print "Installation successful!"
}
```
